Reduce event listeners created when rendering explorer

Every time an explorer item is rendered, we currently hook up a `themeService.onDidFileIconThemeChange` listener for it. This ends up creating a lot of extra event listeners even though this even it pretty rarely fired

Instead, this PR switches us to have a single listener the re-renders the entire tree. Since this should not be a common event, I believe this is reasonable. Profiling also shows that this cuts both the rendering time and amount of garbage generated"

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

Reduce event listeners created when rendering explorer

Every time an explorer item is rendered, we currently hook up a `themeService.onDidFileIconThemeChange` listener for it. This ends up creating a lot of extra event listeners even though this even it pretty rarely fired

Instead, this PR switches us to have a single listener the re-renders the entire tree. Since this should not be a common event, I believe this is reasonable. Profiling also shows that this cuts both the rendering time and amount of garbage generated"

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

Reduce event listeners created when rendering explorer

Every time an explorer item is rendered, we currently hook up a `themeService.onDidFileIconThemeChange` listener for it. This ends up creating a lot of extra event listeners even though this even it pretty rarely fired

Instead, this PR switches us to have a single listener the re-renders the entire tree. Since this should not be a common event, I believe this is reasonable. Profiling also shows that this cuts both the rendering time and amount of garbage generated"

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

Reduce event listeners created when rendering explorer

Every time an explorer item is rendered, we currently hook up a `themeService.onDidFileIconThemeChange` listener for it. This ends up creating a lot of extra event listeners even though this even it pretty rarely fired

Instead, this PR switches us to have a single listener the re-renders the entire tree. Since this should not be a common event, I believe this is reasonable. Profiling also shows that this cuts both the rendering time and amount of garbage generated"

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

Lazily compute icon classes on quick input items

When showing a file list in quick input, we are eagerly resolving all the icons (even for items that are not visible). In the vscode workspace, this results in 512 calls into `getLanguageIds` every time the full quick input is updated (512 is the max number of quick input files we show)

This updates the icon classes to instead be resolved lazily when the quick input items are rendered. This cuts the cost of `getFilePicks` in half"

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

Lazily compute icon classes on quick input items

When showing a file list in quick input, we are eagerly resolving all the icons (even for items that are not visible). In the vscode workspace, this results in 512 calls into `getLanguageIds` every time the full quick input is updated (512 is the max number of quick input files we show)

This updates the icon classes to instead be resolved lazily when the quick input items are rendered. This cuts the cost of `getFilePicks` in half"

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

* wip

* sync widths

* clean up

* remove line

* get it to work

* add wrapping strategy

Co-authored-by: Alex Dima <alexdima@microsoft.com>

* fix issue

* always use the width

* Reduce diffs

* Fix JSON schema for the WrappingStrategy option

* Only turn on advanced wrapping strategy when we know that a screen reader is attached

* Make the textarea's width match the wrapping width when wrapping is enabled and a screen reader might be attached

* Force wrappingIndent to be none when we know a screen reader is attached to get that the textarea's wrapping points match the editor's wrapping points

* remove part of notification message

* adjust z-indices, use content left when wrapped

* use view model rendering data as content when wrapping is enabled

* selection is not working correctly

* mostly fix selection problem

* broke normal wrapping handling

* Revert to using the text model instead of the view model and to using the paged screen reader strategy

* Record also the start position for the text in the textarea

* Expose EndOfLinePreference to `getValueLengthInRange` and fix its implementation in cases where the text EOL wouldn't match the requested EOL

* Fix `getValueLengthInRange` implementation to convert its range from the view coordinate system to the model coordinate system

* Record the visible line count for the text in `value` before `selectionStart` in the text area state

* Fix up line count such that the VoiceOver thick black box lines up correctly with the rendered text

* Make tab characters inside the textarea match the editor's tab width

* Turn off wrapping when doing IME and be sure to measure IME text using the same styles as the `<textarea>`

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

* Revert to using the text model instead of the view model and to using the paged screen reader strategy

* Record also the start position for the text in the textarea

* Expose EndOfLinePreference to `getValueLengthInRange` and fix its implementation in cases where the text EOL wouldn't match the requested EOL

* Fix `getValueLengthInRange` implementation to convert its range from the view coordinate system to the model coordinate system

* Record the visible line count for the text in `value` before `selectionStart` in the text area state

* Fix up line count such that the VoiceOver thick black box lines up correctly with the rendered text

Lazily compute icon classes on quick input items

When showing a file list in quick input, we are eagerly resolving all the icons (even for items that are not visible). In the vscode workspace, this results in 512 calls into `getLanguageIds` every time the full quick input is updated (512 is the max number of quick input files we show)

This updates the icon classes to instead be resolved lazily when the quick input items are rendered. This cuts the cost of `getFilePicks` in half"

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

* fix issue

* always use the width

* Reduce diffs

* Fix JSON schema for the WrappingStrategy option

* Only turn on advanced wrapping strategy when we know that a screen reader is attached

* Make the textarea's width match the wrapping width when wrapping is enabled and a screen reader might be attached

* Force wrappingIndent to be none when we know a screen reader is attached to get that the textarea's wrapping points match the editor's wrapping points

* remove part of notification message

* adjust z-indices, use content left when wrapped

* use view model rendering data as content when wrapping is enabled

* selection is not working correctly

* mostly fix selection problem

* broke normal wrapping handling

* Revert to using the text model instead of the view model and to using the paged screen reader strategy

* Record also the start position for the text in the textarea

* Expose EndOfLinePreference to `getValueLengthInRange` and fix its implementation in cases where the text EOL wouldn't match the requested EOL

* Fix `getValueLengthInRange` implementation to convert its range from the view coordinate system to the model coordinate system

* Record the visible line count for the text in `value` before `selectionStart` in the text area state

* Fix up line count such that the VoiceOver thick black box lines up correctly with the rendered text

* Make tab characters inside the textarea match the editor's tab width

Lazily compute icon classes on quick input items

When showing a file list in quick input, we are eagerly resolving all the icons (even for items that are not visible). In the vscode workspace, this results in 512 calls into `getLanguageIds` every time the full quick input is updated (512 is the max number of quick input files we show)

This updates the icon classes to instead be resolved lazily when the quick input items are rendered. This cuts the cost of `getFilePicks` in half"

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

* fix issue

* always use the width

* Reduce diffs

* Fix JSON schema for the WrappingStrategy option

* Only turn on advanced wrapping strategy when we know that a screen reader is attached

* Make the textarea's width match the wrapping width when wrapping is enabled and a screen reader might be attached

* Force wrappingIndent to be none when we know a screen reader is attached to get that the textarea's wrapping points match the editor's wrapping points

* remove part of notification message

* adjust z-indices, use content left when wrapped

* use view model rendering data as content when wrapping is enabled

* selection is not working correctly

* mostly fix selection problem

* broke normal wrapping handling

* Revert to using the text model instead of the view model and to using the paged screen reader strategy

* Record also the start position for the text in the textarea

* Expose EndOfLinePreference to `getValueLengthInRange` and fix its implementation in cases where the text EOL wouldn't match the requested EOL

* Fix `getValueLengthInRange` implementation to convert its range from the view coordinate system to the model coordinate system

* Record the visible line count for the text in `value` before `selectionStart` in the text area state

* Fix up line count such that the VoiceOver thick black box lines up correctly with the rendered text

* Make tab characters inside the textarea match the editor's tab width

* Turn off wrapping when doing IME and be sure to measure IME text using the same styles as the `<textarea>`

The standalone CLI should detect and fall back to using and
system-installed VS Code instance, rather than trying to download zips
and manage its own VS Code instances.

There are three approaches used for discovery:

- On Windows, we can easily and quickly read the register to find
  installed versions based on their app ID.
- On macOS, we initially look in `/Applications` and fall back to the
  slow `system_profiler` command to list app .app's if that fails.
- On Linux, we just look in the PATH. I believe all Linux installers
  (snap, dep, rpm) automatically add VS Code to the user's PATH.

Failing this, the user can also manually specify their installation dir,
using the command `code version use stable --install-dir /path/to/vscode`.

JS/TS can return a lot of completions. I noticed that just parsing this was taking a bit of time, so I tried to reduce the message size with the following changes:

- Inline the command properties on `ISuggestDataDto`
- Drop the `title` and `tooltip` from the command since we don't use these
- Shorten the delegate command name
- If using an `$ident` command, don't send over the command arguments since the arguments are always `[$ident]`
- Make commit characters a string instead of an array

Here's an example of a dto for a completion item before:

```
{""x"":[2,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":[""."","","","";"",""(""],""m"":{""$ident"":867,""id"":""_vscode_delegate_cmd_l9g7z48t"",""title"":"""",""arguments"":[867]}}
```

And after:

```
{""x"":[1,0],""a"":""$"",""b"":4,""e"":""15"",""i"":0,""k"":"".,;("",""n"":11,""o"":""__vsl9g7vfno""}
```

For global completions in a JS/TS file, this makes the completion response a little over 40% smaller."

Use `Array`.from for mapping instead of separate call to map

- For `Array.from(iter).map(mapper)`, we can use `Array.from(iter, mapper)` which avoids the extra `map`

- For cases where we were using `Array.from(Iterable.map(iter, mapper))`, this can be replaced with `Array.from(iter, mapper)`  which avoids the call to `Iterable.map`"
