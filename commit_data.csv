Vagrant was not behaving correctly in configurations where there was
a static IP on a VirtualBox `intnet` interface and a DHCP `:hostonly`
interface configured.

Since `machine_ip` attempted to get static addresses `||` dynamic
addresses, it would simply use the static machine address and
continue.

This commit corrects this behaviour by collecting all static and
dynamic addresses into the `machine_ip` array instead of just one or
the other.

The result of this is a correctly generated `/etc/exports` on the
host machine, allowing NFS mounts to work correctly in this type of
environment."

As was pointed out by #17128, our blacklist of mutation methods was
non-exhaustive (and would need to be kept up to date with each new

of methods that we actually need to delegate are pretty small. As such,
we can change to explicitly delegating the few non-mutation related

Fixes #22376.

JRuby 9.0.5.0 will support ObjectSpace.each_object against a
class's singleton class, since that's essentially just walking an
internal subclasses structure we already maintain. This test was
too narrow, requiring that each_object support an arbitrary class
but only actually needing it to work against a class's singleton.

This improves performance of Class.descendants by nearly two orders
of magnitude when run against JRuby 9.0.5.0:

5.times { puts Benchmark.measure { 100_000.times { Numeric.descendants } } }

On most filesystems file ctime is limited to 1 second granularity, which means that on
faster computers multiple simple jobs (for instance dummy TestJob) can finish within the
same second.

The execution order test in ActiveJob integration tests relies on multiple TestJobs
writing files then comparing the ctime. As a result integration tests would sometimes
fail as the ctime of the files written by these TestJobs could have coincidental ctimes
making the comparison for job order fail.

This commit adds a far more precise execution time (to the extent that the Ruby Time
class allows) to the file created by TestJob, and updates the execution order assertion
to use it, removing the race condition."

Q: What happens if you initialize an AR model by passing Parameters that
have not been whitelisted with `permit`?

A: An `ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError` is raised.

I think this behavior is correct, and it's better than what used to happen,
with unpermitted parameter being simply ignored."

The previous message was misleading (especially for Ops guys) when
diagnosing problems related to the database connection.

The message was suggesting that the connection cannot be obtained which
normally assumes the need to look at the database.

But this isn't the case as the connection could not be retrieved from
the application's internal connection pool.

non-exhaustive (and would need to be kept up to date with each new

of methods that we actually need to delegate are pretty small. As such,
we can change to explicitly delegating the few non-mutation related

Fixes #22376.

JRuby 9.0.5.0 will support ObjectSpace.each_object against a
class's singleton class, since that's essentially just walking an
internal subclasses structure we already maintain. This test was
too narrow, requiring that each_object support an arbitrary class
but only actually needing it to work against a class's singleton.

This improves performance of Class.descendants by nearly two orders
of magnitude when run against JRuby 9.0.5.0:

```ruby
5.times { puts Benchmark.measure { 100_000.times { Numeric.descendants } } }

On most filesystems file ctime is limited to 1 second granularity, which means that on
faster computers multiple simple jobs (for instance dummy TestJob) can finish within the
same second.

The execution order test in ActiveJob integration tests relies on multiple TestJobs
writing files then comparing the ctime. As a result integration tests would sometimes
fail as the ctime of the files written by these TestJobs could have coincidental ctimes
making the comparison for job order fail.

This commit adds a far more precise execution time (to the extent that the Ruby Time
class allows) to the file created by TestJob, and updates the execution order assertion
to use it, removing the race condition."

The previous message was misleading (especially for Ops guys) when
diagnosing problems related to the database connection.

The message was suggesting that the connection cannot be obtained which
normally assumes the need to look at the database.

But this isn't the case as the connection could not be retrieved from
the application's internal connection pool.

The new message should make it more explicit and remove the confusion."

In the [user module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/user_module.html#user-module), the password field links to `https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/faq.html#how-do-i-generate-crypted-passwords-for-the-user-module`, but the actual link is `https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/faq.html#how-do-i-generate-encrypted-passwords-for-the-user-module` as it was modified in d27d956d71428315397b855e1b094a9caddfa3fd

So I corrected the link in the user module to the actual link.

* nxos_bfd_global: initial commit

This is an initial POC with just a few commands included.  The code has been written somewhat generically so that it can act as a best practices template for re-use in future modules. The implementation follows the yaml cmd_ref style to define each command's getter/setter/type/default. It supports platform-specific defaults.

The basic logic is to collect all relevant data in a `cmd_ref` dict and pass that around to various methods.

In the BFD case the devices don't provide JSON output so we have to screen-scrape with show runs.

BFD does not support present/absent states so there is no state param.

BFD has three different property types to handle. We can add add'l types as needed:

- int
- int_list (list of ints)
- str (needs support for 'no' keyword)

* Use get_capabilities to find platform type

* PR comment fixes, round 1

* Minor cleanups

* nxos_bfd_global: create NxosCmdRef in module_utils

This commit just takes the latest bfd global code and moves the bulk
of the code into new `class NxosCmdRef` in `module_utils/nxos/nxos.py`.

The only remaining code in `nxos_bfd_global.py` are the calls from `main()`.

* Add remaining command properties and documentation

* update argument_spec

* Add check for _exclude; add sanity test

* Add targets files for bfd

* Context and state absent updates

* Add dict support to cmd_ref

* Changed remaining list commands to dict usage

* Add idempotence check for dict

* Fix existing overwrite bug

* Move pattern matching logic into its own method

* add support for 'command: absent'

* Add `get_platform_shortname`; update BFD platform-specific settings

* /absent/deleted/

* Initial proposal for new parameter option for response format
- output_version parameter dictates the response key case
- new is snake_case, old is camelCase
- If new, conversion is done at the end of module execution
- This is purely a proposal and not a final draft

* Add support for ANSIBLE_MERAKI_FORMAT env var
- If env var is set to 'camelcase' it will output camelcase
- Otherwise, will default to snakecase
- Added note to documentation fragment
- As of now, all module documentation needs to be updated

* Fix pep8 errors and remove output_version args

* Restructure check in exit_json so it actually works

* Add changelog fragment

* Change output_format to a parameter with env var fallback
- ANSIBLE_MERAKI_FORMAT is the valid env var
- Added documentation

* Convert to camel_dict_to_snake_dict() which is from Ansible
- Fixed integration tests

* Fix yaml lint error

* exit_json camel_case conversion handles no data
- exit_json would fail if data wasn't provided
- Updated 3 integration tests for new naming convention

* convert_camel_to_snake() handles lists and dicts
- The native Ansible method doesn't handle first level lists
- convert_camel_to_snake() acts simply as a wrapper for the method
- There maybe a situation where nested lists are a problem, must test
- Fixed integration tests in some modules

* A few integration test fixes

* Convert response documentation to snake case"

This resolves an issue where the default freebsd compiler does not
include /usr/local/include which contains important headers such as
GL/gl.h and results in the check_header function failing to find them.

Unfortunately pkg-config/pkgconf will not work here for two reasons.
1. It does not seem able to actually check for gl.h which RetroArch
explicitly needs.

2. Not all systems have a pkg-config implementation so we will still

== DETAILS
This should fix #6025.

After confirming that dummying out the init block of the HID subsystem
driver eliminated the crash, I narrowed it down to the event loop.

And that's when I noticed that, when the thread consumes the event,
it doesn't free it.

Oops.

Updated the event loop to free the event after it has been processed.

== TESTING
Local build, was able to load multiple ROMs in succession where prior
I was getting the system memory errors.

I've #if 0'd out a call to HIDRead that is still getting deadlocked,
because it slows down the startup/shutdown process."

== DETAILS

The joypad driver was only copying the first 16 bits when executing
get_buttons(). The touchpad button is bit 19, so as a result
RETRO_DEVICE_ID_POINTER_PRESSED would never fire.

We fix this for now by copying 32 bits.

the pointer device state functionality."

== DETAILS

Apparently when I refactored this code, I missed out on the fix for
touchpad coordinates that @QuarkTheAwesome had committed.

Oops.

- Fix the touchpad coordinates
- Remove unneeded references to video driver in wpad_driver.c
- Remove unneeded video driver include in pad_driver.h
- Add logging in wpad_driver to verify the fix (#ifdef'd out by default)

== TESTING

Verified fix manually."

This is a proof of concept for the fallback path without pkg-config.
As jack is something often not installed by default it demonstrates
that when pkg-config exists and the dependency doesn't the check_val
function in qb/qb.libs.sh will redundantly check -ljack and as expected,
fail. It also shows that when pkg-config is not installed and jack is
enabled with --enable-jack it will bail and print a configure error."

This accomplishes two things for the fallback path without pkg-config.

1. If --disable-foo is passed to configure it will explicitly skip
   check_val. This has the benefit of reducing checks in
   qb/config.libs.sh which are easy to break due to human error.

2. When a fallback path exists and --enable-foo is passed to configure,
   but fails due to the missing -lfoo check_val will now bail and print
   a configure error. However --enable-foo will still be ignored if
   there is no fallback path and pkg-config is not installed.

One issue with this is that if pkg-config is installed and the package
foo is not, it will still check if -lfoo works. As not all pkg-config
implemenations can be trusted to work even if they exist this seems
unavoidable."

== DETAILS

RetroArch's general HID drivers are intended as a full-on substitute for
other input drivers such as XInput, DInput, SDL, etc. The Wii U port is,
to my knowledge, the first case of heterogenous input drivers working
concurrently.

As such, I've moved things around:

- The HID driver source is moved into the wiiu/input/ directory alongside
  the joypad subdrivers.
- We no longer use the input_hid_init_first() method to instantiate; instead
  we just init the wiiu HID driver directly.
- The HID pad driver and HID subsystem driver enjoy a tighter coupling,
  mainly having to do with the initialization of the joypad connections
  list, because there's no way to inform the HID driver's init() method
  how many slots to allocate.

== DETAILS

The current HID implementation assumes a very low-level USB library
is being used. This causes a problem on Wii U, because the Cafe OS
only exposes a high-level interface.

To get these functions exposed to the HID pad drivers, I had to make
three changes:

1. I added the legacy ""send_control"" function to the HID driver
   interface
2. I modified the signature of pad_connection_pad_init() to send the
   driver pointer instead of the function pointer
3. I updated the HID pad drivers to keep the pointer to the driver
   instead of the function pointer, and updated the calls into the
   send_control function as appropriate
4. I updated the HID drivers to use the new pad init signature

== TESTING
Untested, in theory it should work without a hitch because at this
point all I've done is abstract things a little. I still need to
update the HID pad drivers to use the Wii U-specific calls as

The old code was crashing; I did a minimalized branch and the crash
went away, so I'm bringing that over here. Meaning I'll have to
redo some of the other work I'd put in, but oh well.

(now watch it start crashing again)

== DETAILS
I did a minimalist edit of the HID thread that stripped out all
HID* syscalls, and this stopped the crashing. I then re-added just
the HIDSetup() and HIDTeardown() calls, and the crash came back.

This smells like an OS bug. To work around it, I've put the
HIDSetup() and HIDTeardown() calls into the app init/shutdown
section, so they only get called once in the application lifetime
and not each time the input driver is initialized."

- The thread gets created in init()
- The thread gets stopped in free()

Fixes #58711

When a context menu is triggered from inside another context menu, we have a race condition related to ipc. This is cause by the `close` event for context menus being global. In the retrigger case, `close` ends up being fired after the second context menu is created. This ends up removing the click handler for the new context menu

Fix is to add a menu id to the close event."

**Problem**
We'd like to understand the types of problems users are running into when using the checkJs feature in real world code. This is not something we can determine automatically

**Fix**
The TS team has put together a short survey that will hopefully help them understand how people are using checkJS and what problems they run into. This change adds client side logic to show the survey in the following case:

- A user as opened 10 projects that have checkJS set
- And they have not been prompted to complete the survey previously
- And they have not opted out of all js/ts surveys"

    dump content: kernel pages only
The problem is that dbuf_prefetch along with l2arc can create a zio tree
which confuses the parent zio and allows it to complete with while children
still exist. Here's the scenario:
    zio tree:
        pio
         |--- lio
The parent zio, pio, has entered the zio_done stage and begins to check its
children to see there are still some that have not completed. In zio_done(),
the children are checked in the following order:
    zio_wait_for_children(zio, ZIO_CHILD_VDEV, ZIO_WAIT_DONE)
    zio_wait_for_children(zio, ZIO_CHILD_GANG, ZIO_WAIT_DONE)
    zio_wait_for_children(zio, ZIO_CHILD_DDT, ZIO_WAIT_DONE)
    zio_wait_for_children(zio, ZIO_CHILD_LOGICAL, ZIO_WAIT_DONE)
If pio, finds any child which has not completed then it stops executing and
goes to sleep. Each call to zio_wait_for_children() will grab the io_lock
while checking the particular child.
In this scenario, the pio has completed the first call to
zio_wait_for_children() to check for any ZIO_CHILD_VDEV children. Since
the only zio in the zio tree right now is the logical zio, lio, then it
completes that call and prepares to check the next child type.
In the meantime, the lio completes and in its callback creates a child vdev
zio, cio. The zio tree looks like this:
    zio tree:
        pio
         |--- lio
         |--- cio
The lio then grabs the parent's io_lock and removes itself.
    zio tree:
        pio
         |--- cio
The pio continues to run but has already completed its check for ZIO_CHILD_VDEV
and will erroneously complete. When the child zio, cio, completes it will panic
the system trying to reference the parent zio which has been destroyed.
SOLUTION
========
The fix is to rework the zio_wait_for_children() logic to accept a bitfield
for all the children types that it's interested in checking. The
io_lock will is held the entire time we check all the children types. Since
the function now accepts a bitfield, a simple ZIO_CHILD_BIT() macro is provided
to allow for the conversion between a ZIO_CHILD type and the bitfield used by
the zio_wiat_for_children logic.

Because resuming from a token requires ""guid"" -> ""snapshot"" mapping
we have to walk the whole dataset hierarchy to find the right snapshot
to send; when both source and destination exists, for an incremental
resumable stream, libzfs gets confused and picks up the wrong snapshot
to send from: this results in attempting to send
   ""destination@snap1 -> source@snap2""
instead of
   ""source@snap1 -> source@snap2""
which fails with a ""Invalid cross-device link"" error (EXDEV).
Fix this by adjusting the logic behind dataset traversal in
zfs_iter_children() to pick the right snapshot to send from.
Additionally update dry-run 'zfs send -t' to print its output to
stderr: this is consistent with other dry-run commands.

Project quota is a new ZFS system space/object usage accounting
and enforcement mechanism. Similar as user/group quota, project
quota is another dimension of system quota. It bases on the new
object attribute - project ID.

Project ID is a numerical value to indicate to which project an
object belongs. An object only can belong to one project though
you (the object owner or privileged user) can change the object
project ID via 'chattr -p' or 'zfs project [-s] -p' explicitly.
The object also can inherit the project ID from its parent when
created if the parent has the project inherit flag (that can be
set via 'chattr +P' or 'zfs project -s [-p]').

By accounting the spaces/objects belong to the same project, we
can know how many spaces/objects used by the project. And if we
set the upper limit then we can control the spaces/objects that
are consumed by such project. It is useful when multiple groups
and users cooperate for the same project, or a user/group needs
to participate in multiple projects.

Support the following commands and functionalities:

zfs set projectquota@project
zfs set projectobjquota@project

zfs get projectquota@project
zfs get projectobjquota@project
zfs get projectused@project
zfs get projectobjused@project

zfs projectspace

zfs allow projectquota
zfs allow projectobjquota
zfs allow projectused
zfs allow projectobjused

zfs unallow projectquota
zfs unallow projectobjquota
zfs unallow projectused
zfs unallow projectobjused

chattr +/-P
chattr -p project_id
lsattr -p

This patch also supports tree quota based on the project quota via
""zfs project"" commands set as following:
zfs project [-d|-r] <file|directory ...>
zfs project -C [-k] [-r] <file|directory ...>
zfs project -c [-0] [-d|-r] [-p id] <file|directory ...>
zfs project [-p id] [-r] [-s] <file|directory ...>

For ""df [-i] $DIR"" command, if we set INHERIT (project ID) flag on
the $DIR, then the proejct [obj]quota and [obj]used values for the
$DIR's project ID will be shown as the total/free (avail) resource.
Keep the same behavior as EXT4/XFS does.

before the new snapshot is received. In addition to the fact that
this changes the user's keys for the dataset earlier than they
might expect, the keys were never reset to what they originally

The current design of ZFS encryption only allows a dataset to
have one DSL Crypto Key at a time. As a result, it is important
that the zfs receive code ensures that only one key can be in use
at a time for a given DSL Directory. zfs receive -F complicates
this, since the new dataset is received as a clone of the existing
one so that an atomic switch can be done at the end. To prevent
confusion about which dataset is actually encrypted a check was
added to ensure that encrypted datasets cannot use zfs recv -F to
completely replace existing datasets. Unfortunately, the check did
not take into account unencrypted datasets being overriden by
encrypted ones as a case.

Along the same lines, the code also failed to ensure that raw
recieves could not be done on top of existing unencrypted
datasets, which causes amny problems since the new stream cannot
be decrypted.

Currently, the DMU relies on ZIO layer compression to free LO
dnode blocks that no longer have objects in them. However,
raw receives disable all compression, meaning that these blocks
can never be freed. In addition to the obvious space concerns,
this could also cause incremental raw receives to fail to mount
since the MAC of a hole is different from that of a completely
zeroed block.

This patch corrects this issue by adding a special case in
zio_write_compress() which will attempt to compress these blocks
to a hole even if ZIO_FLAG_RAW_ENCRYPT is set. This patch also
removes the zfs_mdcomp_disable tunable, since tuning it could
cause these same issues.

For a dependency declared in an Ivy descriptor file, one or more

In some cases, one chosen configuration may be extended by another
chosen configuration, rendering the first configuration redundant.
With this change, these redundant configurations are removed from

There is a breaking change here, in that the 'resolved configuration'
resolution result will contain fewer configuration nodes. It will
still contain the same modules and artifacts, in the same order.

While it may appear like legacy configuration selection is another way to choose a particular variant for a component, in many cases the legacy mode may choose multiple configurations from the target component and include them in the graph.

The dependencyInsight hides this fact, by just showing the name of the first configuration that is selected. This change makes this more clear, by concatenating the names of all selected configurations to produce a synthetic 'variant name'.

Doing this makes it apparent that in many cases we are choosing redundant configurations where a single one would do. (e.g. ['default', 'compile', 'runtime'] can often be shorted to ['default']."

This commit introduces the ability to consume capabilities from external
modules. This is a pretty big change for multiple reasons:

- capabilities are no longer known beforehand (before resolution starts) but
can be discovered as we add more nodes to the graph
- conflict resolution cannot fail fast anymore, since it is possible for a
module to declare a capability that triggers a conflict with another module
in the graph, but a 3rd party module can express a preference
- capabilities are consumed from Gradle metadata files
- capabilities from the local component and capabilities from the graph are
merged during resolution

Capabilities are, in published metadata, available at the component level,
with the assumption that capabilities are the same for all variants. It is
not necessary for a module to express a preference for a capability, as
a 3rd party module can declare only a preference, for example."

This commit introduces a DSL to declare ""capabilities"" for modules. Capabilities can be used to declare
that different modules, published at different coordinates, actually provide the same capabilities. This
is typically the case when an API is implemented in different ways (for example, the Slf4j bindings
implement the Slf4j API). It is an error to have multiple modules providing the same capabilities in the
same dependency graph: only one of them should be selected.

This commit adds the ability to declare capabilities, explaining which modules provide the capability, and
provide a way to select the module which will provide that capability. It does NOT make it an error to have
different modules providing the same capability on the graph yet (if a preference is not set).

This solves different use cases:

1. module relocation (`asm:asm` is now found at `org.ow2.asm`)
2. multiple variants of the same module are published at different coordinates (`cglib` vs `cglib-nodep`)
3. multiple implementations of the same API are seen in the graph (`slf4j-simple`, `slf4j-over-log4j`)
4. compatiblity module mimics a different API (log4j2 bridge for log4j1)"

This commit fixes the caching module component repository, which returned a wrong answer
in case of missing modules. When a module was missing from the repository, the answer
was `FAST`, implying that it was cheap to get metadata for the module. However, if there
are more than one repository, this would prevent other repositories from telling if getting
metadata is cheap.

What happened then is that if a module was missing from all repositories, we would answer
that it's fast to get the metadata, and not perform parallel download of metadata."

substitution).

It's worth noting that usage of dependency substitutions force us to select a target
version for the module."

This commit introduces capability conflict resolution, by making it possible to
upgrade a capability to its latest version automatically. It introduces the
capability conflict resolvers infrastructure, which works a bit differently from
the traditional conflict resolvers. Instead of only making a decision, those
resolvers can _evict_ unwanted versions. Then a resolver at the end of the chain
performs the selection if there's only one candidate left.

This will let us implement more complex strategies later, when we will want to
upgrade a capability first, then choose between the remaining candidates."

This commit adds a capabilities extension which can be applied to a project. If it's added, local
components gain the ability to declare capabilities. Currently, only the `java-library` plugin
supports capabilities, but it's expected that more plugins will add it (for example, the native
plugin), which explains why the extension lives in `core`.

When a project declares capabilities, they are bound to configurations. This lets us fail whenever
a local component capability conflicts with a transitive module capability. It will also let us
publish capabilities for local components in a subsequent commit."

Capabilities are a new first-class concept in Gradle, living along variants. They can be used to model
components which ""provide the same capability"". For example, two different implementations of the same
API can provide the same capability, but it's illegal to have both on the dependency graph: the user
must choose between one of the two.

This commit introduces the ability to declare capabilities at the variant level, for now only using
component metadata rules. Capabilities participate in conflict resolution: as soon as we find that two
modules in the graph provide the same capability, we fail. There's currently no way to prefer one over
the other (this is going to be implemented in a subsequent commit). This means that if such a conflict
occurs, the user must select the right module appropriately using component selection rules or module
metadata rules."

This change moves build operation listening out of the standard listener infrastructure, to remove serialisation guarantees.

By moving build operation listening out, overlapping and concurrent signals are now allowed.
This places more responsibility on listener implementations (e.g. thread safety), but there are few and they are all internal.

Additionally, listeners will now never receive progress notifications before start notifications and after finish notifications for that operation."

Multiple origin processors can aggregate multiple source
elements into one output element or create warnings/errors
for such combinations of elements. They need to be provided
with all their elements of interest in the next compilation
when any of them has changed.

We handle this with a very simple approach: If a processor
registers itself for ""*"" (a.k.a all root elements), then we
always do a full recompile. If a processor only registers itself
for specific annotations, then we treat all elements with those
annotations as dirty on every compilation. This means that multiple
origin processors create small non-incremental clusters of code."

For a dependency declared in an Ivy descriptor file, one or more

In some cases, one chosen configuration may be extended by another
chosen configuration, rendering the first configuration redundant.

There is a breaking change here, in that the 'resolved configuration'

While it may appear like legacy configuration selection is another way to choose a particular variant for a component, in many cases the legacy mode may choose multiple configurations from the target component and include them in the graph.

The dependencyInsight hides this fact, by just showing the name of the first configuration that is selected. This change makes this more clear, by concatenating the names of all selected configurations to produce a synthetic 'variant name'.

Doing this makes it apparent that in many cases we are choosing redundant configurations where a single one would do. (e.g. ['default', 'compile', 'runtime'] can often be shorted to ['default']."

1. Base build operation infrastructure is consolidated org.gradle.internal.operations.
2. Mechanism for passing thread global current build operation is more test friendly, and better named.
3. A consistent mechanism is used for binding the current operation to the thread, instead of two mechanisms.

The 'uploadArchives' task generates an ivy file referencing _all_

published to the server.

Our validation of published artifacts was somewhat inconsistent:
- Only published artifacts were checked for existence
- All artifacts were verified not to be a directory.

This commit changes this validation so that only artifacts
that will be published are verified. This allows a unpublished
configuration to have a directory artifact."

This commit introduces the ability to consume capabilities from external
modules. This is a pretty big change for multiple reasons:

- capabilities are no longer known beforehand (before resolution starts) but
can be discovered as we add more nodes to the graph
- conflict resolution cannot fail fast anymore, since it is possible for a
module to declare a capability that triggers a conflict with another module
in the graph, but a 3rd party module can express a preference
- capabilities are consumed from Gradle metadata files
- capabilities from the local component and capabilities from the graph are
merged during resolution

Capabilities are, in published metadata, available at the component level,
with the assumption that capabilities are the same for all variants. It is
not necessary for a module to express a preference for a capability, as
a 3rd party module can declare only a preference, for example."

it _removes_ candidates which are eliminated. The version conflict resolver will
make the final choice. In other words, we:

This commit introduces a DSL to declare ""capabilities"" for modules. Capabilities can be used to declare
that different modules, published at different coordinates, actually provide the same capabilities. This
is typically the case when an API is implemented in different ways (for example, the Slf4j bindings
implement the Slf4j API). It is an error to have multiple modules providing the same capabilities in the
same dependency graph: only one of them should be selected.

This commit adds the ability to declare capabilities, explaining which modules provide the capability, and
provide a way to select the module which will provide that capability. It does NOT make it an error to have
different modules providing the same capability on the graph yet (if a preference is not set).

This solves different use cases:

1. module relocation (`asm:asm` is now found at `org.ow2.asm`)
2. multiple variants of the same module are published at different coordinates (`cglib` vs `cglib-nodep`)
3. multiple implementations of the same API are seen in the graph (`slf4j-simple`, `slf4j-over-log4j`)
4. compatiblity module mimics a different API (log4j2 bridge for log4j1)"

This commit fixes the caching module component repository, which returned a wrong answer
in case of missing modules. When a module was missing from the repository, the answer
was `FAST`, implying that it was cheap to get metadata for the module. However, if there
are more than one repository, this would prevent other repositories from telling if getting
metadata is cheap.

What happened then is that if a module was missing from all repositories, we would answer
that it's fast to get the metadata, and not perform parallel download of metadata."

This commit introduces capability conflict resolution, by making it possible to
upgrade a capability to its latest version automatically. It introduces the
capability conflict resolvers infrastructure, which works a bit differently from
the traditional conflict resolvers. Instead of only making a decision, those
resolvers can _evict_ unwanted versions. Then a resolver at the end of the chain
performs the selection if there's only one candidate left.

This will let us implement more complex strategies later, when we will want to
upgrade a capability first, then choose between the remaining candidates."

This commit adds a capabilities extension which can be applied to a project. If it's added, local
components gain the ability to declare capabilities. Currently, only the `java-library` plugin
supports capabilities, but it's expected that more plugins will add it (for example, the native
plugin), which explains why the extension lives in `core`.

When a project declares capabilities, they are bound to configurations. This lets us fail whenever
a local component capability conflicts with a transitive module capability. It will also let us
publish capabilities for local components in a subsequent commit."

Capabilities are a new first-class concept in Gradle, living along variants. They can be used to model
components which ""provide the same capability"". For example, two different implementations of the same
API can provide the same capability, but it's illegal to have both on the dependency graph: the user
must choose between one of the two.

This commit introduces the ability to declare capabilities at the variant level, for now only using
component metadata rules. Capabilities participate in conflict resolution: as soon as we find that two
modules in the graph provide the same capability, we fail. There's currently no way to prefer one over
the other (this is going to be implemented in a subsequent commit). This means that if such a conflict
occurs, the user must select the right module appropriately using component selection rules or module
metadata rules."

This change moves build operation listening out of the standard listener infrastructure, to remove serialisation guarantees. As logging output now causes build operation notifications, whenever a build operation listener logged something it would fail due to the listener manager blocking overlapping signals.

By moving build operation listening out, overlapping and concurrent signals are now allowed.
This places more responsibility on listener implementations (e.g. thread safety), but there are few and they are all internal.

Additionally, listeners will now never receive progress notifications before start notifications and after finish notifications for that operation."

Multiple origin processors can aggregate multiple source
elements into one output element or create warnings/errors

We handle this with a very simple approach: If a processor
registers itself for ""*"" (a.k.a all root elements), then we
always do a full recompile. If a processor only registers itself
for specific annotations, then we treat all elements with those
annotations as dirty on every compilation. This means that multiple
origin processors create small non-incremental clusters of code."

While it may appear like legacy configuration selection is another way to choose a particular variant for a component, in many cases the legacy mode may choose multiple configurations from the target component and include them in the graph.

The dependencyInsight hides this fact, by just showing the name of the first configuration that is selected. This change makes this more clear, by concatenating the names of all selected configurations to produce a synthetic 'variant name'.

Doing this makes it apparent that in many cases we are choosing redundant configurations where a single one would do. (e.g. ['default', 'compile', 'runtime'] can often be shorted to ['default']."

For an upcoming change to emit console logging as build operation progress events, we need to associate all progress logging with the build operation. This pulled a thread on some long overdue cleanup.

The end result is:

1. Base build operation infrastructure is consolidated org.gradle.internal.operations.
2. Mechanism for passing thread global current build operation is more test friendly, and better named.
3. A consistent mechanism is used for binding the current operation to the thread, instead of two mechanisms.
4. Build operation IDs are typed to OperationIdentifier.

The 'uploadArchives' task generates an ivy file referencing _all_
configurations in a project. However, only a subset of these
configurations are actually published: i.e. have the artifacts
published to the server.

Our validation of published artifacts was somewhat inconsistent:
- Only published artifacts were checked for existence
- All artifacts were verified not to be a directory.

This commit changes this validation so that only artifacts
that will be published are verified. This allows a unpublished
configuration to have a directory artifact."

done to avoid an overhead of classes just aimed at making the DSL nicer. It's
not as nice, but the use was somehow limited."

The current implementation of ""capability discovery"" works well if everyone agrees on the version

conflict, typically), then the constraint is still kept in memory, and we fail. This can be solved
by adding rules to remove the preference (not implemented yet)."

This commit introduces the ability to consume capabilities from external
modules. This is a pretty big change for multiple reasons:

- capabilities are no longer known beforehand (before resolution starts) but
can be discovered as we add more nodes to the graph
- conflict resolution cannot fail fast anymore, since it is possible for a
module to declare a capability that triggers a conflict with another module
in the graph, but a 3rd party module can express a preference
- capabilities are consumed from Gradle metadata files
- capabilities from the local component and capabilities from the graph are
merged during resolution

Capabilities are, in published metadata, available at the component level,
with the assumption that capabilities are the same for all variants. It is
not necessary for a module to express a preference for a capability, as
a 3rd party module can declare only a preference, for example."

It's possible for a module to be both subject to capability conflict resolution AND
version conflict resolution. By making a choice, the capability conflict resolution
enforces a result that we might not want. This commit changes its behavior so that
it _removes_ candidates which are eliminated. The version conflict resolver will
make the final choice. In other words, we:

1. look for capabilities
  * if there are conflicting capabilities and a preference is set, eliminate the non preferred candidates
  * if there's no preference, fail resolution
2. continue with version conflict resolution"

Handling of capabilities is now delegated to the conflict handler, which allows different things:

1. if two modules provide the same capability, but no preference is set, conflict resolution fails
2. there's no need to convert the capabilities to replacement rules anymore

It's worth noting that this currently only works if a single capability is conflicting. Behavior
when there are more than one capability for conflicting modules is undefined at this point (will
be fixed later)"

This commit introduces a DSL to declare ""capabilities"" for modules. Capabilities can be used to declare
that different modules, published at different coordinates, actually provide the same capabilities. This
is typically the case when an API is implemented in different ways (for example, the Slf4j bindings
implement the Slf4j API). It is an error to have multiple modules providing the same capabilities in the
same dependency graph: only one of them should be selected.

This commit adds the ability to declare capabilities, explaining which modules provide the capability, and
provide a way to select the module which will provide that capability. It does NOT make it an error to have
different modules providing the same capability on the graph yet (if a preference is not set).

This solves different use cases:

1. module relocation (`asm:asm` is now found at `org.ow2.asm`)
2. multiple variants of the same module are published at different coordinates (`cglib` vs `cglib-nodep`)
3. multiple implementations of the same API are seen in the graph (`slf4j-simple`, `slf4j-over-log4j`)
4. compatiblity module mimics a different API (log4j2 bridge for log4j1)"

 - Extract the `PrecompiledScriptPlugins` plugin from the `kotlin-dsl`
 plugin so it can be applied independently of `kotlin-dsl` until all
 cacheability issues have been sorted out.
 - Remove implicit imports handling from
 `KotlinBuildScriptDependenciesResolver` as it's now handled by
 `PrecompiledScriptDependenciesResolver`."

This commit fixes the caching module component repository, which returned a wrong answer
in case of missing modules. When a module was missing from the repository, the answer
was `FAST`, implying that it was cheap to get metadata for the module. However, if there
are more than one repository, this would prevent other repositories from telling if getting
metadata is cheap.

What happened then is that if a module was missing from all repositories, we would answer
that it's fast to get the metadata, and not perform parallel download of metadata."

This commit introduces capability conflict resolution, by making it possible to
upgrade a capability to its latest version automatically. It introduces the
capability conflict resolvers infrastructure, which works a bit differently from
the traditional conflict resolvers. Instead of only making a decision, those
resolvers can _evict_ unwanted versions. Then a resolver at the end of the chain
performs the selection if there's only one candidate left.

This will let us implement more complex strategies later, when we will want to
upgrade a capability first, then choose between the remaining candidates."

This commit adds a capabilities extension which can be applied to a project. If it's added, local
components gain the ability to declare capabilities. Currently, only the `java-library` plugin
supports capabilities, but it's expected that more plugins will add it (for example, the native
plugin), which explains why the extension lives in `core`.

When a project declares capabilities, they are bound to configurations. This lets us fail whenever
a local component capability conflicts with a transitive module capability. It will also let us
publish capabilities for local components in a subsequent commit."

Capabilities are a new first-class concept in Gradle, living along variants. They can be used to model
components which ""provide the same capability"". For example, two different implementations of the same
API can provide the same capability, but it's illegal to have both on the dependency graph: the user
must choose between one of the two.

This commit introduces the ability to declare capabilities at the variant level, for now only using
component metadata rules. Capabilities participate in conflict resolution: as soon as we find that two
modules in the graph provide the same capability, we fail. There's currently no way to prefer one over
the other (this is going to be implemented in a subsequent commit). This means that if such a conflict
occurs, the user must select the right module appropriately using component selection rules or module
metadata rules."

This change moves build operation listening out of the standard listener infrastructure, to remove serialisation guarantees. As logging output now causes build operation notifications, whenever a build operation listener logged something it would fail due to the listener manager blocking overlapping signals.

By moving build operation listening out, overlapping and concurrent signals are now allowed.
This places more responsibility on listener implementations (e.g. thread safety), but there are few and they are all internal.

Additionally, listeners will now never receive progress notifications before start notifications and after finish notifications for that operation."

matter, disable the rule and let us work."

Multiple origin processors can aggregate multiple source
elements into one output element or create warnings/errors
for such combinations of elements. They need to be provided
with all their elements of interest in the next compilation
when any of them has changed.

We handle this with a very simple approach: If a processor
registers itself for ""*"" (a.k.a all root elements), then we
always do a full recompile. If a processor only registers itself
for specific annotations, then we treat all elements with those
annotations as dirty on every compilation. This means that multiple
origin processors create small non-incremental clusters of code."
