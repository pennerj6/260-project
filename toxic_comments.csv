349405855,rsbrown,"@linkyndy Do you seriously think @Euraldius did not understand that those labels referred to Ruby objects? Let me slowly explain to you the point that was being made:

When engineers use labels such as ""boy""/""girl"" in ways that reinforce toxic gender stereotypes, such engineers show their ignorance and (perhaps unconscious, perhaps latent) misogyny. So, stop. Think about how you use your language. And be considerate.

Another related example: the widespread use of repulsive ""master""/""slave"" labels in software systems.

Just fucking think about it for a second... bro.",2017-12-05T18:59:56Z,0.862743079662323,https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/issues/683#issuecomment-349405855
