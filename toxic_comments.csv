Profanity aside, you may have a point. I'll take a patch.

Anyway, the point of github issues is to have a bug tracker.

The contributions comes in the pull-requests tab.

16461791,knocte,"I understand that latest_release may not have the proper value when it's queried at the wrong time... but CHANGING BEHAVIOUR???? Sorry for the caps, but really finding out this bug has put me on my nerves.

In regards to your backwards-compatibility policy: fair enough, I understand if you prefer to accept only a patch to fix this in master rather than the 2.0.x branch, but:

a) I never proposed to fix it in a branch.
b) This bug is not fixed yet on any branch, so it should be reopened. Otherwise people confused about it will not be able to find it.

This is, my friend, how bug trackers work.

16462166,leehambley,"I won't fix it, and it's been the way it is for five years without anyone running into problems. I can't afford the time to test it, fix it and make sure it's safe before releasing it. That's what it boils down to. Those variables are a source of a lot of confusion, and they are fragile, and have different meanings wherever you call them, anyway.

I'd like to be able to fix it, your profane issue report aside; but the reality is, I simply can't.

378936727,octoxan,"Running into this issue currently I think.

How does one call the current release path that is right now being built?

I have a task running at `after :updated, :build do` and I'm trying to change directories and then run composer install, but changing directories using release_path is giving me the previous release, not the one currently being built.

Is that this issue? If not I'm sorry but the stackoverflow question led me here and I'm going kind of crazy trying to figure out how to change directories and then run a command, without it doing it in the release that's about to be replaced.
