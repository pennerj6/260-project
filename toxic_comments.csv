349405855,rsbrown,"@linkyndy Do you seriously think @Euraldius did not understand that those labels referred to Ruby objects? Let me slowly explain to you the point that was being made:

When engineers use labels such as ""boy""/""girl"" in ways that reinforce toxic gender stereotypes, such engineers show their ignorance and (perhaps unconscious, perhaps latent) misogyny. So, stop. Think about how you use your language. And be considerate.

Another related example: the widespread use of repulsive ""master""/""slave"" labels in software systems.

Just fucking think about it for a second... bro.",2017-12-05T18:59:56Z,0.862743079662323,https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/issues/683#issuecomment-349405855

419863669,maxymajzr,"> Updates often introduce new bugs and new vulnerabilities. So your just replacing old bugs with new bugs. 

Updates also fix bugs and old vulnerabilities. Using a dependency manager lets you lock down to a specific version of a library. I can fork a library, perform changes, tag it, point my `composer.json` to it. I don't have to do anything manually. If I want to know which *version* I use, I don't have to dig through files.

I could literally go through every single word you wrote and try to argue with you but it's pointless. You suffer from NIH syndrome, your practices are bad and as you wrote - you don't give a shit.

You are spreading dangerous blatant lies in order to justify something you wish were true. That's the problem. The second problem, which is your personal problem, is your attitude. I know there's absolutely no way we can have a discussion, your opinion is set and I can tell you'll do anything to defend your POV. Yes, this is your project, you are entitled to opinion but in your world 1 + 1 yield 75, not 2. Ego is a dangerous thing. I won't insult you, there's no merit to that, we should be civilized after all. 

I'll just kindly ask you, just ASSUME you might be wrong. Just for abstract thinking's sake. I really believe there's no malicious intent behind what you wrote, but could there be a possibility you don't have all the information at hand to make statements such as ""dependencies suck"" or ""dependencies in libraries suck""? What would be the point of a library then? If I deal with SAML or OAuth2, I require a library which in turn requires encryption primitives. Should I rewrite those primitives and libraries to deal with SAML and OAuth2 so I'm ""safe"" and not an idiot?",2018-09-10T10:21:23Z,0.649350643157959,https://github.com/gabordemooij/redbean/issues/450#issuecomment-419863669
